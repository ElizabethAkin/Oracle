# Oracle
It is project in my university. I used C# to create windows forms, Oracle db to keep my data base, rwin to create cheme and integrate it to the Oracle sql developer.
The theme of project is Theater. HR-manager can use it to add, fire worker, change the position of worker, add some vacations.
